# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

### There is not a ton of security needs with this add-on, however, it is set up to be localized to Blender only to make the security tighter.
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version   | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1.X   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
